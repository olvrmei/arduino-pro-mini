KiCAD project for an university assignment of something more or less close to an Arduino Pro Mini board clone.
The assignment required to build at least one custom library for a component. The component chosen was the MIC5205.
Again this is not an exact clone but a fun first project to learn how to use the software for schematic capture and PCB Layout.
